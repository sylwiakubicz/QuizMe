<h1>QuizMe</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Quzime is my first project including both frontend and backend. It served as a learning tool for React and establishing 
communication between the frontend and backend, therefore the user interface is straightforward. 
<br>
<br>
Users can create an account, sign in, and reset their password via email confirmation. During registration, email confirmation is required. Non-logged-in users can browse and solve quizzes, but creating new ones requires logging in. Each user can edit and delete their quizzes, as well as modify their profile information and delete their account. Additionally, a contact form has been added for users to send messages to the administrator. The website utilizes a database to store information about registered users, their uizzes, and results.
